INTRODUCTION

The Munkres module provides an implementation of the Munkres algorithm
(also called the Hungarian algorithm or the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm). The
algorithm models an assignment problem as an NxM cost matrix, where each
element represents the cost of assigning the ith worker to the jth job, and
it figures out the least-cost solution, choosing a single item from each
row and column in the matrix, such that no row and no column are used more
than once.

See the docs in munkres.py for more details.

INSTALLATION

The usual:

    python setup.py install
